**Introduction:**

Nonlinear structural analysis aims to determine the force and displacement behavior of a structure (e.g. buildings, bridges, etc.) once a material yields (permanently deforms). Obtaining the nonlinear structural behavior is vitally important in earthquake-prone regions since material yielding is an energy dissipation mechanism against earthquakes. The goal of the capstone project is to create a nonlinear structural analysis program that uses first-principle physics, linear algebra, numerical methods (i.e. Newton Raphson method) and object-oriented programming principles.
